First, you will need to set up an AWS Simple Email Service (SES) account and verify your email address or domain. This will allow you to send emails using AWS.

Next, create a new Lambda function and select the "SES" trigger. This will cause the Lambda function to execute every time an email is sent using SES.

In the function code, you will need to specify the email addresses that you want to send the email to. You can do this by reading the email addresses from a file or database, or by hardcoding them into the function.

Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to send the email using the send_email method of the boto3.client('ses') client. You will need to specify the sender's email address, the recipient's email address, the subject and body of the email, and any other desired email parameters.

Test the function by sending a test email using SES. If the function is working correctly, it should send the email to all of the specified recipients.

Here is some sample code that demonstrates how to send a mass email using AWS Lambda and SES:
'''

import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Create an SES client
    ses = boto3.client('ses')
    
    # Specify the email addresses of the recipients
    recipients = ['recipient1@example.com', 'recipient2@example.com']
    
    # Send the email
    ses.send_email(
        Source='sender@example.com',
        Destination={'ToAddresses': recipients},
        Message={
            'Subject': {
                'Data': 'Mass Email from AWS Lambda'
            },
            'Body': {
                'Text': {
                    'Data': 'This is a test email sent from an AWS Lambda function.'
                }
            }
        }
    )
    
    # Return a success message
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': 'Mass email sent successfully'
    }
